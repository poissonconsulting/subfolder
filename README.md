# subfolder

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

subfolder is an R package to organize saving and loading R objects, data
frames, tables, plots and code blocks.

The package which is in development will be submitted to CRAN for use in
scripts and research repositories.

It represents a more robust but simplified rewrite of some of the core
functions of the subfoldr2 package.

As before all exported functions will be prefixed by sbf\_.

Unless specified it will use the same function names except main will be
renamed to output which will be the default value.

It will also use … to ensure name based argument matching.
